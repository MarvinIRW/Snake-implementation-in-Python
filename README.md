# Snake implementation in Python

Implementation of the classic game 'Snake' in Python with a few different maps and power-ups.

## Description

The game lets you choose in the beginning one of 6 different maps. Simply click on the preferred one and press the 'Start' button or 'spacebar'. 
You can control the snake with the arrow keys or the standard 'WASD' keys to change the direction of the snake. 
Eat appeals, get long, use power-ups if so desired and try to get a high score in a low time. Difficulty can be chosen in the start menu by clicking with the mouse.
